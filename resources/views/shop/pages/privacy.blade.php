			<p><b>Name and address of the controller</b></p>
			<p>The controller within the meaning of the General Data  Protection Regulation of the EU (GDPR) and other national data protection laws  of the Member States, as well as other data protection provisions:</p>
			<p><!----></p>
			<h2>1. General information relating to data  processing</h2>
			<h3>1.1. Scope of personal data processing</h3>
			<p>We generally only collect and use our users’ personal  data to the extent necessary for providing a functioning website and for our  content and products and services. Our users’ personal data are routinely  collected and used only after the user’s consent has been obtained. An  exception is made in cases where it is not possible to obtain the consent  beforehand for factual reasons and processing of the data is permitted by  statutory provisions.</p>
			<p>Personal data are only collected if you voluntarily  communicate that to us in the context of your order. We exclusively use the  data you have provided to process and complete your order unless you have given  further consent. Upon complete processing of the contract and full payment of  the purchase price, your data will be blocked for further use and deleted after  the retention period for tax and business records has expired insofar as you  have not explicitly consented to further use of your data.</p>
			<h3> 1.2. Sharing of personal data </h3>
			<p> When sending packages and delivering shipments, we share your name, address, phone number and email address with our contracted shipping providers – and any processors – so they can effect delivery and communicate with you about the arrival and coordination of the delivery. </p>
			<p>The legal basis for the data processing involved in this is Article 6 (1a) GDPR, provided you have given us your express consent. To the extent that the data processing is necessary to perform the contractually agreed delivery of goods, the legal basis is Article 6 (1b) GDPR. Furthermore, the legal basis for the data processing involved in this is Article 6 (1f) GDPR (balancing interests based on our interest in providing smooth delivery at the best times possible for you).</p>
			<p> We delete all the aforementioned data no later than when the statutory warranty period ends, unless we are otherwise obligated or entitled to save the data beyond this by the applicable law.</p>
			<p>In order to process payments, we share your payment data with the designated financial institution and/or with the payment service selected in the ordering process.</p>
			<h3>1.3. Use  of personal data when Klarna is selected as the payment option</h3>
			<p>If you have selected Klarna’s payment services such as  Klarna invoice or Klarna instalment purchase as the payment option, you have  consented to us collecting and passing on the following personal data that we  need to process the purchase on account and carry out an identity check and  credit check, such as first name and last name, address, date of birth, gender,  email address, IP address, phone number, as well as the data required to  complete the purchase on account that are associated with the order, such as  the number of articles, article number, invoice amount and taxes as a  percentage. Transmission of this data takes place so Klarna can issue an  invoice and perform an identity check and credit check to process your purchase  with the invoice processing you have selected. According to the German Federal  Data Protection Law, Klarna has a justified interest in the transmission of the  buyer’s personal data in this context and requires same in order to obtain  information for the purpose of performing an identity check and credit check  from credit reference agencies. In Germany, this may be one of the following  credit reference agencies:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>1.  Bürgel Wirtschaftsinformationen GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Postfach 5001 66, 22701  Hamburg</li>
			<li>2.  Creditreform Boniversum GmbH, Hellersbergstrasse 11 41460 Neuss</li>
			<li>3.  Deltavista GmbH, Freisinger Landstr. 74 80939 München</li>
			<li>4. Arvato  Infoscore Consumer Data GmbH and Infoscore Consumer Data GmbH, Rheinstrasse 99, 76532 Baden-Baden</li>
			<li>5 SCHUFA Holding AG, Kormoranweg 5, 65201 Wiesbaden</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the context of the decision on the establishment,  execution or termination of the contractual relationship, Klarna also collects  and uses information about the buyer’s payment history, as well as probability  values regarding their performance in the future, in addition to an address  check. Klarna calculates these scores on  the basis of a scientifically recognised statistical, mathematical procedure.  To this end, Klarna will use your address data among others. In the event that  this calculation shows that you are not creditworthy, Klarna will inform you  immediately.</p>
			<p><strong>Payment by instant transfer (Sofort) (Klarna)</strong></p>
			<p>We also offer the option of paying by instant  transfer. All you need to do this is your account number, BIC or bank sort code  and the PIN and TAN numbers of your online banking account. As part of the  ordering process, you will automatically be directed to the secure payment form  of Sofort GmbH. You will receive a confirmation of the transaction immediately  afterwards. After that, the amount will be credited directly to our account.  Anyone with an activated online banking account set up for the PIN/TAN  procedure may use Sofort instant transfer as a payment option. Please note that  there are a few banks that still do not support payment by instant transfer.</p>
			<p><strong>Withdrawal of consent to the use of personal data  vis-à-vis Klarna.</strong></p>
			<p>1. You may withdraw your consent to the use of  personal data vis-à-vis Klarna any time. However, Klarna may perhaps continue  to be authorised to process, use and transmit the personal data to the extent required  for contractual payment processing by Klarna’s services, by law or by a court  or an authority.</p>
			<p>2. Of course, you can obtain information any time  about the personal data stored by Klarna. This right is guaranteed by the  German Federal Data Protection Law. In the event that you as the buyer wish to  obtain this information or inform Klarna about changes relating to the stored  data, you can contact Klarna at <a href="mailto:privacy@klarna.co.uk">privacy@klarna.co.uk</a>.</p>
			<p><b>1.4. Payment processing using PayPal</b></p>
			<p>If you select payment using PayPal, credit card using  PayPal, direct debit using PayPal or – if offered - “purchase on account” using  PayPal, we will forward your payment data to PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie,  S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg (hereinafter “PayPal”) in the  context of payment processing. PayPal reserves the right to perform a credit  check for the payment options of credit card using PayPal, direct debit using  PayPal or – if offered - “purchase on account” using PayPal. PayPal will use  the result of the credit check with regard to the statistical probability of  non-payment for the purpose of deciding on the provision of the respective  payment method. The information on creditworthiness may contain probability  values (so-called scores). To the extent that scores are included in the result  of the credit check, they are based on a scientifically recognized mathematical,  statistical procedure. Among others, address data are included in the  calculation of the scores. Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">the Privacy Policy for PayPal Services</a> for  more legal information relating to data protection, including with regard to  the credit reference agencies used.</p>
			<p><b>1.5. Legal basis for the processing of personal data</b></p>
			<p>To the extent that we obtain the consent for the  processing procedures of personal data from the data subject, Art. 6 (1) (a) of  the General Data Protection Regulation of the EU (GDPR) serves as the legal  basis.<br>
			During the processing of personal data, which is  necessary for the performance of a contract, the contracting party of which the  data subject is, Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also  applies to processing procedures needed to carry out pre-contractual measures.  To the extent that personal data need to be processed to comply with a legal  obligation that is binding on our company, Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR serves as the  legal basis.<br>
			In the event that vital interests of the data subject  or of another natural person make it necessary to process personal data, Art. 6  (1) (d) GDPR serves as the legal basis.<br>
			If the processing is needed to protect a legitimate  interest of our company or of a third party and if the interests, fundamental  rights and fundamental freedoms of the data subject do not override the  first-mentioned interests, Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR shall serve as the legal basis  for the processing.</p>
			<p><b>1.6. Deletion of data and duration of storage</b></p>
			<p>The personal data of the data subject shall be deleted  or blocked as soon as the purpose of the storage ceases. The data may be stored  beyond the foregoing if provided for by the European or national legislator in  legal Union regulations, laws or other regulations which the controller is  subject to. Blocking or deletion of the data shall also take place if a storage  period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a  necessity to continue to store the data in order to enter into a contract or  perform a contract.</p>
			<h2>2. Provision  of the website and creation of log files</h2>
			<p><b>2.1. Description and scope of data processing</b></p>
			<p>Each time our website is viewed, our system  automatically collects data and information about the computer system of the  accessing computer.</p>
			<p>The following data are collected in this process:</p>
			<p>1. Information  about the type of browser and the version used<br>
			2. The  user’s operating system<br>
			3. The  user’s Internet service provider<br>
			4. The  user’s IP address<br>
			5. Date  and time of the access<br>
			6. Websites  from which the user’s system has accessed our website <br>
			7. Websites  that are accessed from our website by the user’s system</p>
			<p>The log files contain IP addresses or other data  permitting association with a user. This may be the case, for example, if the  link to the website from which the user accesses the website or the link to the  website from which the user transfers contains personal data.</p>
			<p>The data are also stored in the log files of our  system. The user’s IP addresses or other data permitting an association of the  data with a user are not affected by the foregoing. Storage of this data  together with other personal data of the user does not take place.</p>
			<p><b>2.2. Legal basis for the data processing</b></p>
			<p>Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR serves as the legal basis for  the temporary storage of the data and the log files.</p>
			<p><b>2.3. Purpose  of the data processing</b></p>
			<p>The temporary storage of the IP address by the system  is needed to permit delivery of the website to the user’s computer. To do this,  the user's IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.</p>
			<p>Storage in log files takes place in order to ensure  the website’s ability to function. In addition, the data helps us optimize the  website and ensure the security of our information technology systems. An  analysis of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this  process.</p>
			<p>Our legitimate interest in data processing pursuant to  Art.&nbsp;6 (1) (f) GDPR also lies in these purposes.</p>
			<p><b>2.4. Duration of storage</b></p>
			<p>The data shall be erased without undue delay when they  are no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which they were  collected. In the event of collection of the data to provide the website, this  is the case when the respective session is ended.</p>
			<p>In the event that the data are stored in log files,  this will be the case after not later than seven days. Storage extending beyond  that limit is possible. In this case, the user's IP address will be erased or  masked, so that it can no longer be associated with the viewing client.</p>
			<p><b>2.5. Option of objection and removal</b></p>
			<p>Collection of the data for provision of the website  and storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the  website. Therefore, the user has no option of objection.</p>

			<p><b>3.3. Google Ads (formerly Google Adwords):</b></p>
			<p><b>3.3.1. Google Ads Conversion</b></p>
			<p>We use the services of Google Ads to draw attention to our attractive offers with the help of advertising materials (so-called Google Ads) on external websites. We can determine in relation to the data of the advertising campaigns how successful the individual advertising measures are. We are interested in showing you advertisements that are of interest to you, to make our website more interesting for you and to achieve a fair calculation of advertising costs. The advertising materials are delivered by Google via so-called “Ad Servers”. For this purpose, we use ad server cookies, through which certain parameters for measuring success, such as the insertion of ads or clicks by users, can be measured. If you access our website via a Google ad, Google Ads stores a cookie on your device. These cookies usually expire after 30 days and are not intended to identify you personally. For this cookie, the unique cookie id, number of ad impressions per placement (frequency), last impression (relevant for post-view conversions) and opt-out information (mark that the user no longer wishes to be addressed) are usually stored as analysis values.
			These cookies enable Google to recognize your Internet browser. If a user visits certain pages of an Ads customer's website and the cookie stored on their device has not expired, Google and the customer can recognize that the user has clicked on the ad and has been redirected to this page. Each Ads customer is assigned a different cookie. Cookies cannot therefore be traced via the websites of Ads customers. We do not collect and process any personal data in the aforementioned advertising measures. We only receive statistical evaluations from Google. On the basis of these evaluations we can recognize which of the used advertising measures are particularly effective. We do not receive any further data from the use of advertising material; in particular, we cannot identify users on the basis of this information.Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically starts a direct connection to the Google server. We have no influence on the extent and the further use of the data which are raised by the use of this tool by Google and inform you therefore according to our knowledge: By the integration of Ads conversion Google receives the information that you called the appropriate part of our Internet appearance or clicked an announcement of us. If you are registered with a Google service, Google may associate your visit with your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, it is possible that the providers may obtain and store your IP address.</p>
			<p><b>3.3.2. Google Ads Remarketing</b></p>
			<p>We use the remarketing function within the Google Ads service. The remarketing function allows us to present to users of our website advertisements based on their interests on other websites within the Google advertising network (in Google search or on YouTube, so-called "Google ads" or on other websites). For this purpose, the interaction of users on our website is analyzed, e.g. which offers the user was interested in, in order to be able to display targeted advertising to users even after visiting our website on other pages. To do this, Google stores a number in the browsers of users who visit certain Google services or websites in the Google Display Network. This number, known as a "cookie", is used to record the visits of these users. The number is used to uniquely identify a web browser on a particular device and not to identify a person; personal data is not stored.</p>
			<p>You can prevent participation in this tracking process in various ways: a) by setting your browser software accordingly, in particular by suppressing third-party cookies, you will not receive any ads from third-party providers; b) by deactivating cookies for conversion tracking, by setting your browser so that cookies are blocked by the domain www.google.adservices.com, <a href="https://www.google.de/settings/ads" target="_blank">https://www.google.de/settings/ads</a>, this setting being deleted when you delete your cookies; c) by deactivating the interest-based ads of the providers that are part of the “About Ads” self-regulation campaign via the link <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/</a> choices, this setting being deleted when you delete your cookies; d) by permanently deactivating Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome in your browsers under the link <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin</a>, e) by setting your cookie preferences accordingly (click here). Please note that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this offer in full.For more information on the purpose and scope of data collection and processing by Google, please refer to the privacy policy.

			Each access to one of the individual pages of this  website, which is operated by the controller and on which a YouTube component  (YouTube video) has been integrated, causes the Internet browser on the  information technology system of the data subject to be automatically prompted  by the respective YouTube component to download a display of the corresponding  YouTube component of YouTube.

			You have the right to be informed of these recipients  by the controller.</p>
			<p><b>9.6. Right to data portability</b></p>

			<p><b>9.8. Right to withdraw the declaration of consent regarding data privacy</b></p>
			<p>You have the right to withdraw your declaration of  consent regarding data privacy at any time. A withdrawal of consent does not  affect the lawfulness of any processing done up to the time of withdrawal.</p>

			<p>You have the right not to be subjected to a decision  based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal  effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. This shall not  apply if the decision</p>
			<p>1. Is  necessary to enter into or perform a contract between you and the controller;<br>
			2. Is  authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject, and  these legal provisions also lay down suitable measures to safeguard your rights  and freedoms and legitimate interests, or<br>

			<p>The supervisory authority with which the complaint has  been lodged shall inform the complainant on the progress and the outcome of the  complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Art. 78  GDPR.</p>
			<b>10. Live Chat and Co-Browsing</b>
			<p id="p10"><b>Live Chat</b></p>
			<p>With the live chat you have the possibility to get in direct contact with one of our consultants and exchange text messages in real time to inform yourself about our offers, ask questions and get support with the ordering process. In order to provide you with an effective customer service, to quickly restore the communication status in the event of a physical or technical incident and to prevent misuse, we process and store your personal data you enter in the designated fields as well as the information you voluntarily provide us with during the live chat. In addition, we store the following data for the above-mentioned purposes:</p>
			<p>
			- User identification (VR-NetKey),<br>
			- IP address,<br>
			- Date and time of the session,<br>
			- Chat transcript,<br>
			- Operating system and browser.<br>
			</p>
			<p>You can request to get the chat transcript at the beginning of the chat and your trascript will be sent as an email after the chat-conversation is over. We delete your personal data from the live chat not later than 12 months after your live chat session.</p>
			<p><b>Communication via Co-browsing</b></p>
			<p>With co-browsing you temporarily share the contents of your browser window with a person from the customer service so that he or she can advise you as needed. To use the service, you must first be connected to a customer service representative by phone or live chat and confirm the "Yes" button. After your consultant gives you your personal connection id, which  you shall enter in the co-browsing window, your browser content will be shared with the consultant from your phone connection or live chat and he or she will get read privileges.</p>
			<p>You have the option of granting your consultant from the customer service both read and write privileges:</p>
			<p><u>Read privileges:</u> Your consultant can see only the autodoc.co.uk website content inside the browser tab displayed on your screen. He or she can read this content and support you with a pointer function. The consultant cannot see other browser contents or parts of your screen.</p>
			<p><u>Write permissions:</u> Your consultant can support you with a pointer function (like above) and press the mouse buttons for you. This function allows the consultant to search for suitable products for your car and add the items to your basket. However, the windows of the log-in process and the payment procedure are blocked during co-browsing which means that they are invisible to your consultant. </p>
			<p>When you start co-browsing, you agree to share your browser view with your consultant. The co-browsing session ends either when the process is stopped by you or by an automatic time-out. The data processing takes place via session id. We do not record or save data from the browser view. To prevent misuse, we store the following data after the co-browsing process has ended:</p>
			<p>
			- Session id,<br>
			- IP address,<br>
			- Date and time of the session,<br>
			- Operating system and browser.<br>
			</p>
			<p>Your personal data from the co-browsing session will be deleted after 24 hours. Something else applies only if the - limited - further processing for other purposes is necessary and permitted by law.</p>
			<p>For co-browsing it is necessary to set a session cookie.</p>
			<p>Data communication in the live chat and co-browsing is carried out using SSL encryption. The use of encryption is easy to recognize: The display in your browser line changes from "http://" to "https://". Data encrypted via SSL cannot be read by third parties. </p>
			<p>The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR (performance of a contract) or Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR due to our legitimate interest in the statistical analysis of user behaviour for optimisation of our customer service and providing you with effective and secure alternative communication channels. Co-browsing requires your prior consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. You may revoke any consent you have given at any time by stopping the co-browsing with effect for the future, without affecting the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until revocation.   </p>    </div>
